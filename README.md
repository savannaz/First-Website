# This is my first e-commerce website
My goal is to make it compleetely functioning while not losing out on the design aspect.
This project is far from complete. Here is my checklist so far. 
This project uses flask, python3, html5 , external css3, js, & mysql db.
If you would like to help or want to make your own feel free to fork the repo.
